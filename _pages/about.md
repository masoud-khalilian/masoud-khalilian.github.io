# About Me

I am currently a second-year Master's student in data science and engineering at the [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/en), with a Bachelor's degree in computer software and professional experience as a software developer. My research interests include machine and deep learning, computer vision, image segmentation, data visualization, and deep natural language processing.

I have a software development background encompassing front-end, back-end, and mobile app development. As a front-end developer, I designed a stock trading system, optimized data flow, incorporated GraphQL, and reduced latency. Additionally, I have experience creating real-time data visualizations while adhering to regulatory standards. I am well-versed in web development using React and WordPress and have also improved the online presence of multiple organizations and individuals, including Cadence Music Magazine.

I transitioned from holding software engineering jobs to pursuing computer and data science academically because of my passion for using cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. To this end, so far on my journey, I have worked on various research projects, including "Resource Constrained Semantic Segmentation for Waste Sorting" at the Polytechnic University of Turin, "Intent Recognition with SVM and Random Forest," and a Habit Tracking Application. Through these experiences, my technical skills have been honed, and my passion for pushing the boundaries of technology has grown.

When not working on data and computer science, I usually enjoy watching Akira Kurosawa movies and playing chess.
